Ensuring inclusive and accessible education for persons with disabilities remains a vital yet challenging goal in modern pedagogy. 
This project introduces a gamified learning application designed to provide engaging, interactive, and accessible learning experiences tailored to individuals with various disabilities.
A core focus of the project is the effective utilization of HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS3 technologies to build a responsive, interactive, and visually accessible user interface. 
The front end of the application is developed using HTML5, which enables semantic structuring of content and seamless integration of multimedia elements such as audio, video, and canvas-based graphicsâ€”features that are particularly beneficial for learners with visual or cognitive impairments. 
JavaScript is employed to manage interactivity, implement gamification mechanics such as scoring systems, level progression, feedback triggers, and dynamic content updates. 
It also handles user input validation, form control for accessibility settings, and integration with text-to-speech APIs and voice command features. 
CSS3 plays a crucial role in the visual customization of the application, providing accessible design options including high-contrast themes, resizable text, and responsive layouts. 
CSS animations and transitions enhance user experience without overwhelming users with sensory sensitivities.
The system was evaluated through prototype testing with a group of learners with disabilities, showing a notable increase in user engagement, motivation, and retention compared to traditional learning methods. 
By leveraging the combined power of HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS3, the application demonstrates how modern web technologies can contribute to the development of inclusive educational platforms. 
Future work will focus on integrating AI-driven personalization, multilingual support, and broader compatibility with assistive technologies to further enhance learning accessibility and effectiveness.
